                The first image that we created was an imitation of artwork from an artist call Julian Opie. This artist makes art that uses an actual picture of someone's face to trace a more cartoony verion of the picture.

            </div>


            <div class="half">

                We also created two Beth Hockel style manipulations. The first of which we were allowed to use any images from the internet so I decided to make mine of this guy flying on a giant pizza rocket infron of a big mountain.

            </div>


            <div class="half">

                Lastly, we made another Beth Hockel inspired image and this time I was only allowed to use pictures that we had personally taken. I made this colage without really knowing what it would end up like but it ended up looking pretty good and I was happy with it.
